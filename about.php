		<p>This website is a school project. The font used is <a href="http://www.izaksmells.com/2012/06/dwarf-fortress-ttf-font-download.html" target="_blank">Izak's Dwarf Fortress Vanilla Font</a>, imitating the game's default ASCII tileset. The color scheme is a nod to strange moods. The background was generated in Dwarf Fortress. I'm the primary content source. I started playing Dwarf Fortress in early 2007. Background material and references include, but are not limited to, the forums, r/dwarffortress, and Google. If I used something of yours and accidentally didn't source it, or you don't want me to use it, let me know ASAP and I'll source it/take it down immediately. If you have new content, new research, or anything else that would be useful here, get in touch.
